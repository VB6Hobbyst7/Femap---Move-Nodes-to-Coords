This is the same as clicking _Modify_ > _Move To_ > _Node to Location_ except that it skips the X Y Z confirmatin dialog box and moves the node(s) as if all three direction boxes are checked. The vast majority of times I'm moving a node, I want to move all of its coordinates, so this program moves the node(s) without that annoying confirmation each time.
